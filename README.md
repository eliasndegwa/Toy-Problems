These are the first code challenges of phase 1
The first code challenge is to create a student grade calculator.
This calculator allows the user to input individual subject marks.
The calculator then calculates the total marks, assigns the grade and alerts the user if the student passed or failed.
This is found in the Student Grade Generator folder.
The second code challenge is a speed detector program.
This program allows the user to input the speed of the vehicle.
The program then checks if the car went past the speed limit of 70km/h.
If it didn't the program returns the phrase "Ok"
If it went past the speed limit it gives demerit points for evry 5km/h beyond the speed limit.
For example if the speed was 80km/h it would give 2 demerit points
If the demerit points are above 12 the program alerts the user to suspend the license of the car owner.
The program is in the Speed generator folder.
The third code challenge is to create a net salary calculator.
It's major task is to calculate an individualâ€™s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits.
It also calculates the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary.
The calculation rates are found in the following links:
